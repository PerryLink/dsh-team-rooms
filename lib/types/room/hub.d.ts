/**
 * RoomHub: the host-side service behind team rooms. It opens the
 * `team_rooms` storage domain, owns every room mutation (membership, the
 * message bus, the task board, the timeline), and drives delivery:
 *
 * - every write queues on ONE hub chain (the domain's single write chain is
 *   the ordering authority — concurrent posters cannot interleave a
 *   read-modify-write, and bus seqs mint strictly in commit order);
 * - model-visible delivery goes through the official inbox
 *   (`agent.followup` wakes live members; offline members receive their
 *   backlog through `agent.inject` when their session next starts), so every
 *   model-visible room message is a durable `user/message` event in the
 *   member's own session log — model-visible ⟺ recorded;
 * - the shared timeline mirrors into every member's log as log-only
 *   `team-room/fact` events (ignorable), so the `teamRoom` projection
 *   reconstructs the room view from each member's own durable log;
 * - per-member delivery is at-least-once and ordered: a crash between bus
 *   commit and delivery re-delivers on catch-up (the cursor only advances
 *   after delivery), and per-member chains serialize delivery order.
 *
