 * and the `0.1.1-rc` line silently drop the options bag, and the

 * compatibility but never accept an options bag either (the third append
 * parameter is `SurfaceIntent` for surface event types only), so fact
 * events land unmarked on all of them and stricter hosts refuse to resume
 * those sessions (`SessionFormatUnsupportedError`).
 * The fact appender detects the host before polluting a log: the installed
 * peer version is checked against the known-unmarked lines first, and an
 * unknown (unresolvable) version is verified by probing the FIRST
 * appended event's returned envelope. The same discipline lives in
 * `dsh-permission-rules` and `dsh-auto-review`.
