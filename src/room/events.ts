/**
 * The room-owned durable fact event: `team-room/fact`, appended to every
 * MEMBER session log as a log-only record stamped with the envelope's
 * `ignorable: true` marker (the same discipline as the background-agents
 * fact channel). Two invariants hold:
 *
 * - model-visible ⟺ recorded: the messages the member's model sees are
 *   delivered through the official inbox (`agent.followup`/`agent.inject`,
 *   durable `user/message` events), while the shared timeline rides these
 *   log-only facts — the room store (`team_rooms` domain) stays the
 *   cross-session authority;
 * - catch-up completeness: members offline while a fact landed receive every
 *   missed fact (and bus message) in store order on their next activation, so
 *   the `teamRoom` projection always reconstructs the shared view from the
 *   member's own log.
 *
 * Every timeline-bearing fact carries the canonical store `timelineSeq`, so
 * the folded view orders exactly like the room store.
 *
