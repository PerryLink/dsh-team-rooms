## Checklist

- [ ] CI gates pass locally — `pnpm run typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm run build && git diff --exit-code lib/` (CI additionally runs the pinned-harness pack smoke)
- [ ] Tests added or updated for the behavior change (or a note in the description why none are needed)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated — add a `## [version]` entry under the `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Added` heading
- [ ] Multi-language READMEs kept in sync — `README.md` is the source of truth; `README-zh.md` / `README-es.md` / `README-pt.md` / `README-hi.md` follow
- [ ] Related issue linked (e.g. `Fixes #123`)
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, credentials, or personal data in the diff
